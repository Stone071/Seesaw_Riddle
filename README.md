# Seesaw Riddle

This is a little game version of the seesaw riddle I first heard on Brooklyn 99.

The riddle: There are 12 people on an island. There is a seesaw on the island. 11 of the people weigh the exact same amount. The other person has a slightly different weight. The user must determine who the person of unequal weight is using only the seesaw, and the seesaw can only be used 3 times.

NOTE: The balance computation does not take into account the distance of the people from the fulcrum of the seesaw. It is computed as if all people present on the seesaw are equidistant from the fulcrum.
